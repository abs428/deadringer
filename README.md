Creates near duplicates of the records in datasets by adding different kinds of noise.
This system can be used to test the efficacy of an [entity resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) framework.

A submodule `fakedata` that generates fake data that resembles real data is also under development.

This project is inspired by and borrows heavily from the [FEBRL](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Peter.Christen/Febrl/febrl-0.3/febrldoc-0.3/manual.html) project.
